## Themes

If you are working on a large site with multiple themes like I do, having a `themes/` folder can make sense. You can stuff all your theme/design related styles in there. This is definitely project-specific so be sure to include it only if you feel the need.

* `_theme.scss`
* `_admin.scss`
