##Base

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate stuff for your project. In there, you might find the reset (or Normalize.css, or whatever), probably some stuff dealing with typography, and, depending on the project, maybe some other files.

* `_reset.scss`gs or `_normalize.scss`
* `_fonts.scss`
