## Helpers

The `helpers/` folder (sometimes called `utils/`) gathers all Sass tools and helpers weâ€™ll use across the project. Got a function? A mixin? Put it in there. This folder also contains a _variables.scss file (sometimes `_config.scss`) which holds all global variables for the project (for typography, color schemes, and so on).

`_variables.scss`
`_mixins.scss`
`_functions.scss`
`_placeholders.scss` (frequently named `_helpers.scss`)
