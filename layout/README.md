## Layout

The `layout/` directory (sometimes called `partials/`) usually contains a number of files, each of them setting some styles for the main sections of the layout (header, footer, and so on). It also contains the `_grid` file which is the grid system used to build the layout.

`_grid.scss`
`_header.scss`
`_footer.scss`
`_sidebar.scss`
`_forms.scss`
Having the navigation file (`_navigation.scss`) in this folder could make sense although I use to put it in `components/`. I think it would be better in the `/layout` folder but Iâ€™ll let you decide.
