##Components

For smaller components, there is the `components/` folder (frequently called `modules/`). While layout/ is kind of macro (defining the global wireframe), `components/` is more micro. It can contain all kinds of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, or anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in `components/` since your site is should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
